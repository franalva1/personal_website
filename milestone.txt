Project Title: FAC Personal Website

Overview
--------

So far I have designed each page and have pseudocoded layouts on paper. I am currently in the process of making this layout a reality in css and html. 
From there, I need to implement the backend and api, but so far I have not ran into any problems.

Implementation Details
----------------------

I made the top bar housing the different webpages a flexbox which allows me to easily manipulate the layout into a row. 
Also using image import in html I have learned to put images on webpages. Likewise, I also used media only screen which
we learned in lecture.

External libraries and code
---------------------------

Have not needed to implement external libraries yet.

Collaboration and resources
---------------------------

I have not consulted any sources.

Anything else?
