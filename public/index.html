        I go out late at night. A study on introversion and introspection.
        Turn the noise on: producing and playing music for social gatherings is my poison. The
        natives go manic while I tend my post, reflecting, steering towards
        another direction...<i>or dimension.</i> "Trippy Tech House Mix" by Flor on Youtube, I'll meet you there.

        Experimental, bittersweet and undone. PPCF is a fashion project aimed
        at something that I have no idea how to get to. I do not know where, but it 
        takes me there. Bold, severe and chaotic. Everybody likes tie dye. <i>Consume.</i>

        The STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) fair. Days spent formulating the largest event any public school
        would have ever seen. A classic story of innovation being killed by bureaucrats. Nothing new.

        I built an Apple II Computer out of a Raspberry Pi. <i>Systems is tough.</i> Really really really really tough.

        This appears to be a gingerbread house. You are wrong. This is a concept. It began a few years ago as a
         means of exploring the true essence of architecture. 
        This was the house made in 2022. I thought the theme was growth. <i>I was wrong.</i>

        y otros van llorando."
        A metaphor for the metaphorical. Contemplating my contemplation. Everything and nothing. 1955. "MERRY XMAS 2021" by <i>yours truly</i>
        on Youtube. This will make sense one day.

        If you take a light sensor, a lot of wires, a pvc pipe, 3 Stanford students, a Raspberry Pi and a lot of skill in systems 
        programming, you are probably not too far off from having enough to build a bomb. 
        Rather than have to meet with the FBI again, we decided to build The Debugger. This was an arcade game we developed from the ground up
        in about a week. It was frugal, frustrating fun. The Debugger 
        is a metaphor for society.

        A 30 page proposal, multiple altercations with the police, phone calls with old land owners, and good memories with friends. No, we
        were not able to build the esteemed <i>Team Rampage Mountain Bike Jump Park.</i> It lives on in our heads, or atleast thats what I read on Wikipedia.
