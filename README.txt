Project Title: Personal Website 
Your Name: Francisco Alvarez Clemente
Your SUNetID: franalva

Overview
--------

This is my personal website where I hope to display -- perhaps vaguely -- some of my prior projects. 
Should anybody wish to contact me regarding anything there is a message board that people can send things to.


Running
-------

No, I will leave mongoDB empty. If you play around with the submission form you can fill up the database with information. 

Features
--------

Try submitting information through the form to do so. To see the database of messages posted submit a form with only the name field filled out with "F8"

Collaboration and libraries
---------------------------

No

Anything else?
-------------

This was a great introduction to web programming. This is my first time doing anything related to web programming and I feel like 
I learned so much. Thanks Michael for bringing in the energy each day.
